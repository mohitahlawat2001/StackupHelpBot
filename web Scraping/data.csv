Learn & Earn's New Reward Mechanism,"What is Learn & Earn’s Reward Mechanism? 
Since Learn & Earn started, we have always rewarded players on a first-come, first-served basis. This means that the fastest players to submit a quest receive rewards. In response to user feedback highlighting the challenge of earning rewards and the pressure to quickly complete quests, Learn & Earn is trying out a new reward distribution system. This change is intended to ensure that everyone has an opportunity to earn rewards for their effort and hard work, even if they may not be able to participate right away when a quest launches. We want to continue rewarding our very dedicated players who are there at 1200 hrs GMT+8 to start questing, so a portion of the rewards will be reserved for the fastest players. The remaining rewards will be distributed via the new mechanism.
For all quests included in this experimental reward mechanism, it will be stated explicitly in the quests’ introduction. 
How it works? 
Example 1: Random Allocation Mechanism
Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, and 2000 players submit their entries.
1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward.
The remaining 500 rewards are randomly distributed among the 1000 approved players who weren't the fastest to submit. Each of these remaining players has a 50% chance of receiving a reward.
Example 2: Even Distribution Mechanism
Imagine a scenario where a quest provides 1500 rewards, each valued at $1, totalling a prize pool of $1500. 2000 players have submitted their entries.1000 rewards are reserved for the fastest players. This means that the fastest 1000 players are guaranteed with the $1 reward.
After distributing $1000 to the fastest players, $500 remains in the prize pool. This remaining amount is then evenly divided among the remaining 1000 approved players who have not received a reward yet. Consequently, each of these players will receive 50 cents.
FAQs
1. How will I know if I am one of the fastest players to receive a reward?Your quest status will be ‘rewarded’ and you can also view your reward in your list of transactions on the ""Balance & Request History"" page found under ""My Balance"".
2. How is the random allocation conducted?We will use a seed for a random number generator (RNG). The RNG will then generate a list of numbers which will correspond to a player’s submission number. 3. How will I know if I have been rewarded in the random allocation mechanism?As this mechanism is still in the experimental stage, users who are rewarded via the new mechanism will see the approved status. However, you can view transactions on the ""Balance & Request History"" page found under ""My Balance"". If you are rewarded, you will see your reward for the quest as a transaction. 
4. How can I provide feedback on the new reward mechanism? You can visit our Discord server and head to the [ideas-and-feedback channel] channel to share your thoughts.Disclaimer: This initiative is currently in the experimental phase, with potential changes to how it works. It will undergo limited testing for a while and its future implementation is still uncertain. Any updates will be communicated clearly."

We receive a large number of submissions and we reward submissions based on a first-come-first-served basis. Once the rewards have been given out, the rest of the submissions are approved. 
If you wish to be rewarded, we would advise you to attempt the quest and submit it as early as you can. Generally, our Stackies who submit on the day of the quest start date have a very high likelihood of being rewarded.

Is it possible to work with a group on a bounty project?,"Yes, collaborative efforts can be valuable, especially for intricate challenges that require diverse expertise. It's permissible to collaborate with colleagues while working on a bounty. However, please bear in mind that when it comes to reward distribution, the reward will be credited to the account responsible for submitting the deliverable.

How are StackUp Bounties different from Quests?,"StackUp Quests require Stackies to follow a specific set of learning instructions to achieve the same outcome. Bounties are more open-ended. Bounty hunters may use different code, or choose to build different features—depending on the Bounty. Since Bounties are more complex, they will also generally include higher reward sums.
If you have been disappointed because Quest rewards have run out before your submission, you’ll love Bounties! Bounties are rewarded on quality. During the review period, our reviewers will go through all submissions to select and reward only the best ones. So don’t rush to submit! Make sure you work hard to deliver the best quality work within the Bounty availability period.

We recommend using the Core Wallet or Metamask as it has been tested and used by the StackUp team. Stackies can find more information about the Core Wallet [here] and Metamask [here] for guidance on the wallet creation. 
Step 2 - Ensure that your wallet can receive tokens on the C-chain. Open your wallet and navigate to the section displaying your wallet addresses. Locate the C-chain address, which begins with ""0x"".The example shown below is using the CORE wallet.  Step 3 - After obtaining your public address on the C-chain, go to the StackUp Earn page.

StackUp will send USDC(AVAX C-chain) tokens directly to the wallet address provided. Stackies must ensure that their wallet address can receive C-chain tokens.USDC maintains a 1:1 ratio with USD. So the amount of USD withdrawn = the amount of USDC received. Important notes: ✏️ StackUp will send USDC tokens to the provided addresses. If players wish to convert USDC tokens to USD or other tokens, they need to secure their own AVAX tokens for transaction fees and find an online token exchange that serves their region and performs the conversion themselves.✏️ Please note that StackUp can only ensure that withdrawal requests are successfully sent to the provided payment details. Regrettably, we are unable to provide any assurances about any events that occur after the successful transaction."

📕 StackUp's Payment Methods,"StackUp currently supports two payment methods. 
a. WISE (Through WISE tag/ Email Address)




StackUp uses WISE to pay out our stackies who wish to receive their rewards in local currency (FIAT). These payouts can be obtained in your WISE balance or directly transferred to the bank account you have set as the primary receiver on WISE.







 



b. USDC stablecoin (cryptocurrency) via AVAX network
StackUp sends USDC and it maintains a 1:1 ratio with USD. So the amount of USD withdrawn = the amount of USDC received.

Engaging with Learn enhances your chances of successfully learning and earning from our Earn quests and campaigns!"
Do you offer certification upon completion of a Learn Pathway or module?,"At this time, we do not offer certifications. We highly encourage you to showcase and post your accomplishments achieved through StackUp, whether it's a project completed after a free Learn module, a rewarded quest, or a standout bounty submission, on your GitHub repository and LinkedIn profile. Additionally, if you actively participate in our community events on Discord, mentioning this on your LinkedIn will highlight your engagement and reliability as a community member. 
This will help showcase the knowledge and skills you have gained through our comprehensive Learn pathways, quests, or bounties, serving as a valuable reference and demonstrating your expertise to potential employers or project clients."
📕 Platform Integrity Policy,"At StackUp, we are committed to maintaining a fair and meaningful learning environment for all of our Stackies. We have a zero-tolerance policy for any form of cheating or exploitation. Our Platform Integrity Policy outlines the expectations, guidelines, and consequences related to maintaining submission, account integrity and user conduct on our platform.

User Conduct: We expect all users to treat one another with respect and courtesy. Harassment, hate speech, or any form of discrimination will not be tolerated. Users are required to act ethically and honestly, this includes refraining from cheating, plagiarism, or any form of dishonesty.

Cheating: The following is a list of actions that are flagged as cheating on the StackUp platform, including but not limited to:

A single user with multiple accounts
A single user making multiple submissions using multiple accounts
Copying of submissions from other users and/or wholesale content from online sources (e.g Codepen, StackOverflow, GitHub, YouTube, etc.)
Sharing of withdrawal information



Consequences: Users who are flagged for misconduct or multiple cheating attempts will be suspended and not be allowed back on the platform to protect our community. Users will be informed via their StackUp registered email address of any warnings or actions taken if they are identified for cheating, such as:

Current and future submissions will be rejected and not be eligible for submission re-review requests
Withdrawal requests will be restricted
Clawback of a rewarded quest to rejected as it was gained unfairly through cheating
Removal of access to our community on Discord in cases where clear instances of harassment and verbal abuse occur within the community. 
Account Suspension

The above actions are not enforced linearly and may be dependent on one another. The appropriate action will be determined based on the type of cheating involved. These actions are taken after conducting a comprehensive investigation, coupled with thoughtful consideration and robust justification for each decision made. We are committed to ensuring that every action we take is based on a well-founded and justified assessment of the situation.


Abuse Reporting: Users are encouraged to report any form of platform abuse, including cheating, harassment, or violations of this policy through privately messaging our Community Moderators or using the General Enquiry form. Your reports play a vital role in maintaining a safe and respectful community. All abuse reports will be treated with utmost confidentiality, we are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring that you can use our platform without fear of retaliation or exposure when reporting abusive behaviour.


Appeal: Our quests are intentionally designed to make it difficult for users who complete the content on their own to submit work that is similar enough to be suspected of being a copied submission. A manual review is also conducted by our team for users who have been flagged for suspicious activity to ensure accuracy.
However, users who believe that they have been mistakenly flagged for cheating can submit an appeal through our StackUp Help Centre Submission-Related-Matters Form. Appeals will be carefully re-reviewed by our team; however, please note that we cannot guarantee that a second review is done for every case and reserve the right to uphold our decision based on the evidence available."
Can I join the new StackUp Learn & Earn if I'm a suspended user from the old platform?,"We strongly advise against joining the new StackUp Learn & Earn as the suspension on the old StackUp platform also extends to the new platform.
While you can participate in quests, earn rewards, and perhaps be able to submit a withdrawal request on the new platform, there's a high risk of cancellation or failure, and StackUp will not be held responsible for any accumulated reward amounts affected by observed suspension records from the old platform."
What happens after you are flagged with suspicious activity?,"Stackies flagged for suspicious activity will receive email notifications and submission reason codes based on the type of cheating involved. Expect an email within 1-5 working days regarding actions taken on your account. Below are two scenarios you might encounter when flagged, along with their implications and suggested actions.
Scenario 1: Your quest submission has been flagged for suspicious activity, and you have received a warning email. However, your account has not been suspended.
StackUp Platform Rejection Feedback:
""Your account has been flagged for suspicious activity. Please see the Guide for more info.""
Email Notifications
“Regarding Your Recent Submission (Warning)”
If you receive this email, your account is not suspended. This indicates that the warning pertains only to a specific quest and will not affect your future quest submissions. However, your account will be closely monitored and may be suspended if the team observes or identifies other suspicious indicators.
 
Scenario 2: Your quest submission has been rejected because your account is suspended and is currently under investigation.
StackUp Platform Rejection Feedback:
“Your account is currently under investigation for suspension. We will not be considering your deliverable.”
Email Notifications
“🤔 Your Account is on Temporary Suspension: Duplicated Bank Details Detected”
“🤔 Your Account is on Temporary Suspension: Duplicated Wallet Details Detected”
“Account Suspension Notification”
Your account may be suspended due to a violation of our policy, and the specific reason may constitute the below:
     2.1 Your account has been temporarily suspended due to duplicated withdrawal details detected.
As sharing withdrawal details constitutes cheating under our policy, your account may be temporarily suspended and withdrawal features will be restricted until this is resolved. Stackies should follow the email notification for instructions on updating their withdrawal details and having their features resumed. If our investigation determines that your account can be lifted from the temporary suspension, please note that any past submissions submitted during the suspension will not be reviewed again. However, rest assured that future submissions will not be affected unless another suspicious activity is observed.
      2.2 Your account has been suspended due to flagged suspicious activity.
Our policy follows a zero-tolerance approach towards Stackies who engage in cheating and/or exploitative measures to gain an unfair advantage towards the prize pool money. Stackies who are found to have breached StackUp's policy multiple times will have their account suspended, rewards revoked, withdrawals restricted, and you will no longer have access to your Learn & Earn account. Suspended users will also not be allowed to create a new account on our platform."
How can I avoid being flagged with suspicious activity?,"To ensure a seamless learn-and-earn experience on the platform and avoid being flagged for cheating, below are some guidelines recommended for Stackies to follow:

Attempt the quest on your own.
Never send your screenshot or your code to someone else.
Delete your screenshots immediately if you are sharing a workstation.
Do not copy sections of code wholesale from internet resources, but instead edit and refine your code as necessary.
Discussion within the community is encouraged when faced with difficulties. However, do not ask for direct yes/no or correct/incorrect answers on the help channels.
Do not share same withdrawal details.
Having multiple accounts on the platform is not allowed"
How can I find out who I am suspected of cheating with?,"We understand that Stackies may want some visibility as to why they have been suspended or flagged, however our internal processes and data privacy considerations prohibit us from sharing specific evidence or details related to individual cases. Please understand that this measure is in place to protect not only the privacy of the users involved but also the integrity of our detection methods.
While we are unable to provide details that would include other user’s personal data, submissions or other sensitive processes, we will still outline the steps that we took as due diligence so you are aware of the steps that have been taken. Our decisions are not taken lightly and are based on a careful review of available information, a commitment to maintaining fairness for all users, and a strong commitment to user privacy.
We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to strive for a positive and secure platform experience for all users."
How does StackUp identify cheating?,"StackUp employs various advanced detection software, as well as AI and machine learning models, to identify suspicious user behaviour, submissions, and other activities on our platform. These automated systems alert us to certain high-risk signals and indicators for investigation, which are then complemented by human intervention for a thorough review to ensure that our checks are comprehensive and multi-layered.
Below briefly outlines the steps that we use to detect on cheating users and submission, which includes but not limited to:

Identification of highly suspicious activity (submissions and user behaviours) through system detection against various resources, users' platform behaviour, and account history.
Manual human intervention for further investigation and review of flagged users and/or activity before concluding that suspicious activity has taken place."
Which countries are not supported by StackUp?,"To ensure StackUp complies with all applicable laws and regulations, we are updating the list of countries supported by our platform, effective from November 9, 2022.
Unfortunately, we will no longer be able to support Stackies residing in or citizens of the following regions/countries:

Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (North Korea)
Republic of Sudan
Russia
Islamic Republic of Iran
Republic of Cuba
Ukraine
Syrian Arab Republic
State of Libya
Federal Republic of Somalia
Republic of Yemen
Democratic Republic of the Congo

Why are these countries not supported?
StackUp, along with our campaign partners and payment providers, must adhere to legal obligations. Upon review, we have determined that supporting Stackies from these countries is restricted by applicable laws. This includes challenges in awarding quest rewards and processing payments through our payment providers. Despite our best efforts, we regret that we are unable to facilitate rewards for Stackies in these countries.
Additionally, due to system limitations and complexities, residents of the following countries may also face challenges joining our platform:

Afghanistan
Pakistan
Palestinian Territory
Iraq

We appreciate your understanding as we work to uphold legal compliance while striving to support as many Stackies as possible."
"What does ""can't support certain countries"" or limited platform access mean?","Users from these countries, whether residing in the region or citizens of it, will not be able to perform certain actions, including but not limited to submitting quests, earning monetary rewards, and making withdrawal requests. However, the affected Stackies will still be able to interact with other Stackies on Discord community channels."
